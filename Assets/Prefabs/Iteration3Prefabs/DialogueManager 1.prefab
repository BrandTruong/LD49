  - "Ah, welcome back Player! Couldn\u2019t help but play again huh? "
  - And who could blame you!
  - The replay value is what separates MY games from others...
  - A bridge! A box! A key! And a button that opens a door!
  - You get to experience all that thrill and exhilaration again.
  - Other games might make you come up with another way to solve the same puzzle.
  - "But remember, MY game isn\u2019t like other games.  "
  - "There\u2019s only one solution: the correct one. "
  - 'Go ahead, solve this room again, just like I told you last time. '
  - "Move something onto the button and claim your reward! I\u2019ll get the confetti
    ready. "
